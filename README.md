# BIOL 7180 — Code Review Proposal

## Paper
- Martin, M. (2011). *Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads*. EMBnet.journal, 17(1), 10–12.
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200

## Associated code
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt
- Documentation: https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/

## Why I chose this paper/code
I chose Cutadapt because it is a widely used bioinformatics tool for processing sequencing data and it has strong public documentation and an actively maintained open-source codebase. This makes it feasible to evaluate code organization, usability, testing practices, documentation quality, and reproducibility in a realistic scientific software project.
